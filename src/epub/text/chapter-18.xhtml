			<p>After his interview with Zagloba, Ketling went to Pan Michael’s sister, whom he informed that because of urgent affairs he must remain in the city, and perhaps too before his final journey he would go for some weeks to Courland; therefore he would not be able in person to entertain her in his suburban house longer. But he implored her to consider that house as her residence in the same way as hitherto, and to occupy it with her husband and Pan Michael during the coming election. Pani Makovetski consented, for in the opposite event the house would become empty, and bring profit to no one.</p>
			<p>After that conversation Ketling vanished, and showed himself no more either in the inn, or later in the neighborhood of Mokotov, when Pan Michael’s sister returned to the suburbs with the young ladies. Krysia alone felt that absence; Zagloba was occupied wholly with the coming election; while Basia and Pani Makovetski had taken the sudden decision of Krysia to heart so much that they could think of nothing else.</p>
			<p>Still, Pani Makovetski did not even try to dissuade Krysia; for in those times opposition to such undertakings seemed to people an injury and an offence to God. Zagloba alone, in spite of all his piety, would have had the courage to protest, had it concerned him in any way; but since it did not, he sat quietly, and he was content in spirit that affairs had arranged themselves so that Krysia retired from between Pan Michael and the haiduk. Now Zagloba was convinced of the successful accomplishment of his most secret desires, and gave himself with all freedom to the labors of the election; he visited the nobles who had come to the capital, or he spent the time in conversations with the vice-chancellor, with whom he fell in love at last, becoming his trusted assistant. After each such conversation he returned home a more zealous partisan of the “Pole,” and a more determined enemy of foreigners. Accommodating himself to the instructions of the vice-chancellor, he remained quietly in that condition so far, but not a day passed that he did not win someone for the secret candidate, and that happened which usually happens in such cases⁠—he pushed himself forward so far that that candidacy became the second object in his life, at the side of the union of Basia and Pan Michael. Meanwhile they were nearer and nearer the election.</p>
			<p>Spring had already freed the waters from ice; breezes warm and strong had begun to blow; under the breath of these breezes the trees were sprinkled with buds, and flocks of swallows were hovering around, to spring out at any moment, as simple people think, from the ocean of winter into the bright sunlight. Guests began to come to the election, with the swallows and other birds of passage. First of all came merchants, to whom a rich harvest of profit was indicated, in a place where more than half a million of people were to assemble, counting magnates with their forces, nobles, servants, and the army. Englishmen, Hollanders, Germans, Russians, Tartars, Turks, Armenians, and even Persians came, bringing stuffs, linen, damask, brocades, furs, jewels, perfumes, and sweetmeats. Booths were erected on the streets and outside the city, and in them was every kind of merchandise. Some “bazaars” were placed even in suburban villages; for it was known that the inns of the capital could not receive one tenth of the electors, and that an enormous majority of them would be encamped outside the walls, as was the case always during time of election. Finally, the nobles began to assemble so numerously, in such throngs, that if they had come in like numbers to the threatened boundaries of the Commonwealth, the foot of any enemy would never have crossed them.</p>
			<p>Reports went around that the election would be a stormy one, for the whole country was divided between three chief candidates⁠—Condé, the Princes of Neuberg and of Lorraine. It was said that each party would endeavor to seat its own candidate, even by force. Alarm seized hearts; spirits were inflamed with partisan rancor. Some prophesied civil war; and these forebodings found faith, in view of the gigantic military legions with which the magnates had surrounded themselves. They arrived early, so as to have time for intrigues of all kinds. When the Commonwealth was in peril, when the enemy was putting the keen edge to its throat, neither king nor hetman could bring more than a wretched handful of troops against him; but now in spite of laws and enactments, the Radzivills alone came with an army numbering between ten and twenty thousand men. The Patses had behind them an almost equivalent force; the powerful Pototskis were coming with no smaller strength; other “kinglets” of Poland, Lithuania, and Russia were coming with forces but slightly inferior. “When wilt thou sail in, O battered ship of my country?” repeated the vice-chancellor, more and more frequently; but he himself had selfish objects in his heart. The magnates, with few exceptions, corrupted to the marrow of their bones, were thinking only of themselves and the greatness of their houses, and were ready at any moment to rouse the tempest of civil war.</p>
			<p>The throng of nobles increased daily; and it was evident that when, after the Diet, the election itself would begin, they would surpass even the greatest force of the magnates. But these throngs were incompetent to bring the ship of the Commonwealth into calm waters successfully, for their heads were sunk in darkness and ignorance, and their hearts were for the greater part corrupted. The election therefore gave promise of being prodigious, and no one foresaw that it would end only shabbily, for except Zagloba, even those who worked for the “Pole” could not foresee to what a degree the stupidity of the nobles and the intrigues of the magnates would aid them; not many had hope to carry through such a candidate as Prince Michael. But Zagloba swam in that sea like a fish in water. From the beginning of the Diet he dwelt in the city continually, and was at Ketling’s house only when he yearned for his haiduk; but as Basia had lost much joyfulness by reason of Krysia’s resolve, Zagloba took her sometimes to the city to let her amuse herself and rejoice her eyes with the sight of the shops.</p>
			<p>They went out usually in the morning; and Zagloba brought her back not infrequently late in the evening. On the road and in the city itself the heart of the maiden was rejoiced at sight of the merchandise, the strange people, the many-colored crowds, the splendid troops. Then her eyes would gleam like two coals, her head turn as if on a pivot; she could not gaze sufficiently, nor look around enough, and overwhelmed the old man with questions by the thousand. He answered gladly, for in this way he showed his experience and learning. More than once a gallant company of military surrounded the equipage in which they were riding; the knighthood admired Basia’s beauty greatly, her quick wit and resolution, and Zagloba always told them the story of the Tartar, slain with duck-shot, so as to sink them completely in amazement and delight.</p>
			<p>A certain time Zagloba and Basia were coming home very late; for the review of Pan Felix Pototski’s troops had detained them all day. The night was clear and warm; white mists were hanging over the fields. Zagloba, though always watchful, since in such a concourse of serving-men and soldiers it was necessary to pay careful attention not to strike upon outlaws, had fallen soundly asleep; the driver was dozing also; Basia alone was not sleeping, for through her head were moving thousands of thoughts and pictures. Suddenly the tramp of a number of horses came to her ears. Pulling Zagloba by the sleeve, she said⁠—</p>
			<p>“Horsemen of some kind are pushing on after us.”</p>
			<p>“What? How? Who?” asked the drowsy Zagloba.</p>
			<p>“Horsemen of some kind are coming.”</p>
			<p>“Oh! they will come up directly. The tramp of horses is to be heard; perhaps someone is going in the same direction⁠—”</p>
			<p>“They are robbers, I am sure!”</p>
			<p>Basia was sure, for the reason that in her soul she was eager for adventures⁠—robbers and opportunities for her daring⁠—so that when Zagloba, puffing and muttering, began to draw out from the seat pistols, which he took with him always for “an occasion,” she claimed one for herself.</p>
			<p>“I shall not miss the first robber who approaches. Auntie shoots wonderfully with a musket, but she cannot see in the night. I could swear that those men are robbers! Oh, if they would only attack us! Give me the pistol quickly!”</p>
			<p>“Well,” answered Zagloba, “but you must promise not to fire before I do, and till I say fire. If I give you a weapon, you will be ready to shoot the noble that you see first, without asking, ‘Who goes there?’ and then a trial will follow.”</p>
			<p>“I will ask first, ‘Who goes there?’ ”</p>
			<p>“But if drinking-men are passing, and hearing a woman’s voice, say something impolite?”</p>
			<p>“I will thunder at them out of the pistol! Isn’t that right?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, man, to take such a water-burner to the city! I tell you that you are not to fire without command.”</p>
			<p>“I will inquire, ‘Who goes there?’ but so roughly that they will not know me.”</p>
			<p>“Let it be so, then. Ha! I hear them approaching already. You may be sure that they are solid people, for scoundrels would attack us unawares from the ditch.”</p>
			<p>Since ruffians, however, really did infest the roads, and adventures were heard of not infrequently, Zagloba commanded the driver not to go among the trees which stood in darkness at the turn of the road, but to halt in a well-lighted place. Meanwhile the four horsemen had approached a number of yards. Then Basia, assuming a bass voice, which to her seemed worthy of a dragoon, inquired threateningly⁠—</p>
			<p>“Who goes there?”</p>
			<p>“Why have you stopped on the road?” asked one of the horsemen, who thought evidently that they must have broken some part of the carriage or the harness.</p>
			<p>At this voice Basia dropped her pistol and said hurriedly to Zagloba, “Indeed, that is uncle. Oh, for God’s sake!”</p>
			<p>“What uncle?”</p>
			<p>“Makovetski.”</p>
			<p>“Hei there!” cried Zagloba; “and are you not Pan Makovetski with Pan Volodyovski?”</p>
			<p>“Pan Zagloba!” cried the little knight.</p>
			<p>“Michael!”</p>
			<p>Here Zagloba began to put his legs over the edge of the carriage with great haste; but before he could get one of them over, Volodyovski had sprung from his horse and was at the side of the equipage. Recognizing Basia by the light of the moon, he seized her by both hands and cried⁠—</p>
			<p>“I greet you with all my heart! And where is Panna Krysia, and sister? Are all in good health?”</p>
			<p>“In good health, thank God! So you have come at last!” said Basia, with a beating heart. “Is uncle here too? Oh, uncle!”</p>
			<p>When she had said this, she seized by the neck Pan Makovetski, who had just come to the carriage; and Zagloba opened his arms meanwhile to Pan Michael. After long greetings came the presentation of Pan Makovetski to Zagloba; then the two travellers gave their horses to attendants and took their places in the carriage. Makovetski and Zagloba occupied the seat of honor; Basia and Pan Michael sat in front.</p>
			<p>Brief questions and brief answers followed, as happens usually when people meet after a long absence. Pan Makovetski inquired about his wife; Pan Michael once more about the health of Panna Krysia; then he wondered at Ketling’s approaching departure, but he had not time to dwell on that, for he was forced at once to tell of what he had done in the border stanitsa, how he had attacked the ravagers of the horde, how he was homesick, but how wholesome it was to taste his old life.</p>
			<p>“It seemed to me,” said the little knight, “that the Lubni times had not passed; that we were still together with Pan Yan and Kushel and Vyershul; only when they brought me a pail of water for washing, and gray-haired temples were seen in it, could a man remember that he was not the same as in old times, though, on the other hand, it came to my mind that while the will was the same the man was the same.”</p>
			<p>“You have struck the point!” replied Zagloba; “it is clear that your wit has recovered on fresh grass, for hitherto you were not so quick. Will is the main thing, and there is no better drug for melancholy.”</p>
			<p>“That is true⁠—is true,” added Pan Makovetski. “There is a legion of well-sweeps in Michael’s stanitsa, for there is a lack of spring water in the neighborhood. I tell you, sir, that when the soldiers begin to make those sweeps squeak at daybreak, your grace would wake up with such a will that you would thank God at once for this alone, that you were living.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, if I could only be there for even one day!” cried Basia.</p>
			<p>“There is one way to go there,” said Zagloba⁠—“marry the captain of the guard.”</p>
			<p>“Pan Adam will be captain sooner or later,” put in the little knight.</p>
			<p>“Indeed!” cried Basia, in anger; “I have not asked you to bring me Pan Adam instead of a present.”</p>
			<p>“I have brought something else, nice sweetmeats. They will be sweet for Panna Basia, and it is bitter there for that poor fellow.”</p>
			<p>“Then you should have given him the sweets; let him eat them while his mustaches are coming out.”</p>
			<p>“Imagine to yourself,” said Zagloba to Pan Makovetski, “these two are always in that way. Luckily the proverb says, ‘Those who wrangle, end in love.’ ”</p>
			<p>Basia made no reply; but Pan Michael, as if waiting for an answer, looked at her small face shone upon by the bright light. It seemed to him so shapely that he thought in spite of himself, “But that rogue is so pretty that she might destroy one’s eyes.”</p>
			<p>Evidently something else must have come to his mind at once, for he turned to the driver and said, “Touch up the horses there with a whip, and drive faster.”</p>
			<p>The carriage rolled on quickly after those words, so quickly that the travellers sat in silence for some time; and only when they came upon the sand did Pan Michael speak again: “But the departure of Ketling surprises me. And that it should happen to him, too, just before my coming and before the election.”</p>
			<p>“The English think as much of our election as they do of your coming,” answered Zagloba. “Ketling himself is cut from his feet because he must leave us.”</p>
			<p>Basia had just on her tongue, “Especially Krysia,” but something reminded her not to mention this matter nor the recent resolution of Krysia. With the instinct of a woman she divined that the one and the other might touch Pan Michael at the outset; as to pain, something pained her, therefore in spite of all her impulsiveness she held silence.</p>
			<p>“Of Krysia’s intentions he will know anyhow,” thought she; “but evidently it is better not to speak of them now, since Pan Zagloba has not mentioned them with a word.”</p>
			<p>Pan Michael turned again to the driver, “But drive faster!”</p>
			<p>“We left our horses and things at Praga,” said Pan Makovetski to Zagloba, “and set out with two men, though it was nightfall, for Michael and I were in a terrible hurry.”</p>
			<p>“I believe it,” answered Zagloba. “Do you see what throngs have come to the capital? Outside the gates are camps and markets, so that it is difficult to pass. People tell also wonderful things of the coming election, which I will repeat at a proper time in the house to you.”</p>
			<p>Here they began to converse about politics. Zagloba was trying to discover adroitly Makovetski’s opinions; at last he turned to Pan Michael and asked without ceremony, “And for whom will you give your vote, Michael?”</p>
			<p>But Pan Michael, instead of an answer, started as if roused from sleep, and said, “I am curious to know if they are sleeping, and if we shall see them today?”</p>
			<p>“They are surely sleeping,” answered Basia, with a sweet and as it were drowsy voice. “But they will wake and come surely to greet you and uncle.”</p>
			<p>“Do you think so?” asked the little knight, with joy; and again he looked at Basia, and again thought involuntarily, “But that rogue is charming in this moonlight.”</p>
			<p>They were near Ketling’s house now, and arrived in a short time. Pani Makovetski and Krysia were asleep; a few of the servants were up, waiting with supper for Basia and Pan Zagloba. All at once there was no small movement in the house; Zagloba gave command to wake more servants to prepare warm food for the guests.</p>
			<p>Pan Makovetski wished to go straightway to his wife; but she had heard the unusual noise, and guessing who had come, ran down a moment later with her robe thrown around her, panting, with tears of joy in her eyes, and lips full of smiles; greetings began, embraces and conversation, interrupted by exclamations.</p>
			<p>Pan Michael was looking continually at the door, through which Basia had vanished, and in which he hoped any moment to see Krysia, the beloved, radiant with quiet joy, bright, with gleaming eyes, and hair twisted up in a hurry; meanwhile, the Dantzig clock standing in the dining-room ticked and ticked, an hour passed, supper was brought, and the maiden beloved and dear to Pan Michael did not appear in the room.</p>
			<p>At last Basia came in, but alone, serious somehow, and gloomy; she approached the table, and taking a light in her hand, turned to Pan Makovetski: “Krysia is somewhat unwell, and will not come; but she begs uncle to come, even near the door, so that she may greet him.”</p>
			<p>Pan Makovetski rose at once and went out, followed by Basia.</p>
			<p>The little knight became terribly gloomy and said, “I did not think that I should fail to see Panna Krysia tonight. Is she really ill?”</p>
			<p>“Ei! she is well,” answered his sister; “but people are nothing to her now.”</p>
			<p>“Why is that?”</p>
			<p>“Then has his grace, Pan Zagloba, not spoken of her intention?”</p>
			<p>“Of what intention, by the wounds of God?”</p>
			<p>“She is going to a convent.”</p>
			<p>Pan Michael began to blink like a man who has not heard all that is said to him; then he changed in the face, stood up, sat down again. In one moment sweat covered his face with drops; then he began to wipe it with his palms. In the room there was deep silence.</p>
			<p>“Michael!” said his sister.</p>
			<p>But he looked confusedly now on her, now on Zagloba, and said at last in a terrible voice, “Is there some curse hanging over me?”</p>
			<p>“Have God in your heart!” cried Zagloba.</p>
