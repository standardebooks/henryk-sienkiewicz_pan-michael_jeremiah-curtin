			<p>The snow fell so thickly that it filled the stanitsa trench altogether, and settled on the stockade wall like a mound. Outside were night and a storm; but the chief room in Hreptyoff was blazing with light. There were two violins, a bass-viol, a flageolet, a French horn, and two bugles. The fiddlers worked away till they were turning in their seats. The cheeks of the flageolet player and the buglers were puffed out, and their eyes were bloodshot. The oldest officers sat on benches at the wall, one near another⁠—as gray doves sit before their cotes in a roof⁠—and while drinking mead and wine looked at the dancers.</p>
			<p>Basia opened the ball with Pan Mushalski, who, despite advanced years, was as great a dancer as a bowman. Basia wore a robe of silver brocade edged with ermine, and resembled a newly blown rose in fresh snow. Young and old marvelled at her beauty, and the cry “Save us!” came involuntarily from the breasts of many; for though Panna Eva and Panna Zosia were somewhat younger, and beautiful beyond common measure, still Basia surpassed all. In her eyes delight and pleasure were flashing. As she swept past the little knight she thanked him for the entertainment with a smile; through her open rosy mouth gleamed white teeth, and she shone in her silver robe, glittering like a sun-ray or a star, and enchanted the eye and the heart with the beauty of a child, a woman, and a flower. The split sleeves of her robe fluttered after her like the wings of a great butterfly; and when, raising her skirt, she made an obeisance before her partner, you would think that she was floating on the earth like a vision, or one of those sprites which on bright nights in summer skip along the edges of ravines.</p>
			<p>Outside, the soldiers pressed their stern mustached-faces against the lighted windowpanes, and flattening their noses against the glass peered into the room. It pleased them greatly that their adored lady surpassed all others in beauty, for they held furiously to her side; they did not spare jests, therefore, and allusions to Panna Eva, or Panna Zosia, and greeted with loud hurrahs every approach that Basia made to the window.</p>
			<p>Pan Michael increased like bread-rising, and nodded his head, keeping time with Basia’s movements; Pan Zagloba, standing near, held a tankard in his hand, tapped with his foot and dropped liquor on the floor; but at times he and the little knight turned and looked at each other with uncommon rapture and puffing.</p>
			<p>But Basia glittered and glittered through the whole room, ever more joyous, ever more charming. Such for her was the Wilderness. Now a battle, now a hunt, now amusements, dancing and music, and a crowd of soldiers⁠—her husband the greatest among them, and he loving and beloved; Basia felt that all liked and admired her, gave her homage⁠—that the little knight was happy through that; and she herself felt as happy as birds feel when spring has come, and they rejoice and sing lustily and joyously in the air of May. The second couple were Azya and Eva Novoveski, who wore a crimson jacket. The young Tartar, completely intoxicated with the white vision glittering before him, spoke not one word to Eva; but she, thinking that emotion had stopped the voice in his breast, tried to give him courage by pressure of her hand, light at the beginning, and afterward stronger. Azya, on his part, pressed her hand so powerfully that hardly could she repress a cry of pain; but he did this involuntarily, for he thought only of Basia, he saw only Basia, and in his soul he repeated a terrible vow, that if he had to burn half Russia she should be his.</p>
			<p>At times, when consciousness came to him somewhat, he felt a desire to seize Eva by the throat, stifle her, and gloat over her, because she pressed his hand, and because she stood between him and Basia. At times he pierced the poor girl with his cruel, falcon glance, and her heart began to beat with more power; she thought that it was through love that he looked at her so rapaciously.</p>
			<p>Pan Adam and Zosia formed the third couple. She looked like a forget-me-not, and tripped along at his side with downcast eyes; he looked like a wild horse, and jumped like one. From under his shod heels splinters were flying; his forelock was soaring upward; his face was covered with ruddiness; he opened his nostrils wide like a Turkish charger, and sweeping Zosia around, as a whirlwind does a leaf, carried her through the air. The soul grew glad in him beyond measure, since he lived on the edge of the Wilderness whole months without seeing a woman. Zosia pleased him so much at first glance, that in a moment he was in love with her to kill. From time to time he looked at her downcast eyes, at her blooming cheeks, and just snorted at the pleasant sight; then all the more mightily did he strike fire with his heels; with greater strength did he hold her, at the turn of the dance, to his broad breast, and burst into a mighty laugh from excess of delight, and boiled and loved with more power every moment.</p>
			<p>But Zosia had fear in her dear little heart; still, that fear was not disagreeable, for she was pleased with that whirlwind of a man who bore her along and carried her with him⁠—a real dragon! She had seen various cavaliers in Yavorov, but such a fiery one she had not met till that hour; and none danced like him, none swept her on so. In truth, a real dragon! What was to be done with him, since it was impossible to resist?</p>
			<p>In the next couple, Panna Kaminski danced with a polite cavalier, and after her came the Armenians⁠—Pani Kyeremovich and Pani Neresevich, who, though wives of merchants, were still invited to the company, for both were persons of courtly manners, and very wealthy. The dignified Naviragh and the two Anardrats looked with growing wonder at the Polish dances; the old men at their mead cups made an increasing noise, like grasshoppers on stubble land. But the music drowned every voice, and in the middle of the room delight grew in all hearts.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Basia left her partner, ran panting to her husband, and clasped her hands before him.</p>
			<p>“Michael,” said she, “it is so cold outside the windows for the soldiers, give command to let them have a keg of <i xml:lang="uk-Latn">gorailka</i>.”</p>
			<p>He, being unusually jovial, fell to kissing her hands, and cried⁠—</p>
			<p>“I would not spare blood to please you!”</p>
			<p>Then he hurried out himself to tell the soldiers at whose instance they were to have the keg; for he wished them to thank Basia, and love her the more.</p>
			<p>In answer, they raised such a shout that the snow began to fall from the roof; the little knight cried in addition, “Let the muskets roar there as a vivat to the Pani!” Upon his return to the room he found Basia dancing with Azya. When the Tartar embraced that sweet figure with his arm, when he felt the warmth coming from her and her breath on his face, his pupils went up almost into his skull, and the whole world turned before his eyes; in his soul he gave up paradise, eternity, and for all the houris he wanted only this one.</p>
			<p>Then Basia, when she noticed in passing the crimson jacket of Eva, curious to know if Azya had proposed yet, inquired⁠—</p>
			<p>“Have you told her?”</p>
			<p>“No.”</p>
			<p>“Why?”</p>
			<p>“It is not time yet,” said he, with a strange expression.</p>
			<p>“But are you greatly in love?”</p>
			<p>“To the death, to the death!” answered the Tartar, with a low but hoarse voice, like the croaking of a raven.</p>
			<p>And they danced on, immediately after Pan Adam, who had pushed to the front. Others had changed partners, but Pan Adam did not let Zosia go; only at times he seated her on a bench to rest and recover breath, then he revelled again. At last he stopped before the orchestra, and holding Zosia with one arm, cried to the musicians⁠—</p>
			<p>“Play the <i xml:lang="pl">krakoviak</i>! on with it!”</p>
			<p>Obedient to command, they played at once. Pan Adam kept time with his foot, and sang with an immense voice⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Lost are crystal torrents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the Dniester River;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lost in thee, my heart is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lost in thee, O maiden!</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="und">U-há!</i>”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>And that <i xml:lang="und">U-há</i> he roared out in such Cossack fashion that Zosia was drooping from fear. The dignified Naviragh, standing near, was frightened, the two learned Anardrats were frightened; but Pan Adam led the dance farther. Twice he made the circle of the room, and stopping before the musicians, sang of his heart again⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Lost, but not to perish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though the current snatch it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the depth ’twill seek out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bear back a gold ring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="und">U-há!</i>”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“Very pretty rhymes,” cried Zagloba; “I am skilled in the matter, for I have made many such. Bark away, cavalier, bark away; and when you find the ring I will continue in this sense⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“Flint are all the maidens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Steel are all the young men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll have sparks in plenty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you strike with will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="und">U-há!</i>”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“Vivat! vivat Pan Zagloba!” cried the officers, with a mighty voice, so that the dignified Naviragh was frightened, and the two learned Anardrats were frightened, and began to look at one another with exceeding amazement.</p>
			<p>But Pan Adam went around twice more, and seated his partner at last on the bench, panting, and astonished at the boldness of her cavalier. He was very agreeable to her, so valiant and honest, a regular conflagration; but just because she had not met such a man hitherto, great confusion seized her⁠—therefore, dropping her eyes still lower, she sat in silence, like a little innocent.</p>
			<p>“Why are you silent; are you grieving for something?” asked Pan Adam.</p>
			<p>“I am; my father is in captivity,” answered Zosia, with a thin voice.</p>
			<p>“Never mind that,” said the young man; “it is proper to dance! Look at this room; here are some tens of officers, and most likely no one of them will die his own death, but from arrows of Pagans or in bonds⁠—this one today, that tomorrow. Each man on these frontiers has lost someone, and we make merry lest God might think that we murmur at our service. That is it. It is proper to dance. Laugh, young lady! show your eyes, for I think that you hate me!”</p>
			<p>Zosia did not raise her eyes, it is true; but she began to raise the corners of her mouth, and two dimples were formed in her rosy cheeks.</p>
			<p>“Do you love me a little bit?” asked he.</p>
			<p>And Zosia, in a still lower voice, said, “Yes; but⁠—”</p>
			<p>When he heard this. Pan Adam started up, and seizing Zosia’s hands, began to cover them with kisses, and cry⁠—</p>
			<p>“Lost! No use in talking; I love you to death! I don’t want anyone but you, my dearest beauty! Oh, save me, how I love you! In the morning I’ll fall at your mother’s feet. What?⁠—in the morning! I’ll fall tonight, so as to be sure that you are mine!”</p>
			<p>A tremendous roar of musketry outside the window drowned Zosia’s answer. The delighted soldiers were firing, as a vivat for Basia; the windowpanes rattled, the walls trembled. The dignified Naviragh was frightened a third time; the two learned Anardrats were frightened; but Zagloba, standing near, began to pacify them.</p>
			<p>“With the Poles,” said he to them, “there is never rejoicing without outcry and clamor.”</p>
			<p>In truth, it came out that all were just waiting for that firing from muskets to revel in the highest degree. The usual ceremony of nobles began now to give way to the wildness of the steppe. Music thundered again; dances burst out anew, like a storm; eyes were flashing and fiery; mist rose from the forelocks. Even the oldest went into the dance; loud shouts were heard every moment; and they drank and frolicked⁠—drank healths from Basia’s slipper; fired from pistols at Eva’s boot-heels. Hreptyoff shouted and roared and sang till daybreak, so that the beasts in the neighboring wilds hid from fear in the deepest thickets.</p>
			<p>Since that was almost on the eve of a terrible war with the Turkish power, and over all these people terror and destruction were hanging, the dignified Naviragh wondered beyond measure at those Polish soldiers, and the two learned Anardrats wondered no less.</p>
